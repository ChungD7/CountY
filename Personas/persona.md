*Descriptor*: Advanced Placement United States Government High School Teacher

*Quote*: “The most important thing you can do to prepare for the A.P. test is to get a good night’s sleep, so don’t stay up late reviewing or anything (this means you, Jake Wang). P.S. I’ll have bagels in Room 26 starting at 7 a.m.”

He understands the bugs that occur in the digital web today and is merely satisfied with the option to display data in a unique way that might immerse his students.
