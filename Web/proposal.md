## Collaboration Plan
We will garner a collaborative environment, in which each member feels as if his ideas are considered with equal value and weight. Communication is essential, and we rely on Slack to communicate to each other and keep track of each day’s deliverables and upcoming major deadlines. We will uphold the standard of meeting at least once before a major deadline to ensure that all members are certain of the deliverables that need to be finished. Furthermore, Google Drive serves as the main platform for our group’s document writing.

For now, we have no concrete framework or outline for each individual’s roles and tasks; however, we do prefer distributing the work at each step of the process, rather than assigning major portions to a particular individual.
